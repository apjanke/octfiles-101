Oct-Files 101
=============

So you want to do some advanced GNU Octave programming?

This document is a gentle introduction to the programming of oct-files.
Oct-files are Octave extensions written in C++ that let you get performance or connectivity that is hard with regular Octave M-code.

You can read the guide online at https://apjanke.github.io/octfiles-101/.

# About this project

This is just something I threw together after I had to do a bit of oct-file
programming but couldn't find an easy introduction to the basics.

The project home is at [the Octfiles 101 repo on GitHub](https://github.com/apjanke/octfiles-101).
Contributions of all sorts, including bug reports, suggestions, and complaints, are welcome.
