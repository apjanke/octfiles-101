Octfiles 101 TODO
=================

* Write some of the document.
* Pick a license.
* Write example code to go with the document.
* Create a Makefile, to:
  * Build all examples.
* Figure out a way to actually include the document examples from the source code, to ensure they're never out of sync, and always tested by compiling.
* Travis CI setup
  * Build all examples. Maybe run them, too?
* Find examples of Octave Forge packages that use Oct-Files and use them as reference.

* See if Matlab/Octave syntax highlighting can be enabled in Markdown code snippets?
  * The highlight.js page includes Matlab in the [“scientific” section](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/).
